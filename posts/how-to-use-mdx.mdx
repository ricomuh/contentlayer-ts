# How to use MDX with Next.js

MDX is a great way to write React components in Markdown. It's a great way to write blog posts, documentation, and more. In this post, we'll go over how to use MDX with Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, we'll need to install the dependencies we need. We'll need `@mdx-js/loader` and `@mdx-js/react`:

```bash
npm install @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react
```

Next, we'll need to add a new loader to our `next.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.mdx?$/,
      use: [
        defaultLoaders.babel,
        {
          loader: "@mdx-js/loader",
          options: {
            remarkPlugins: [],
            rehypePlugins: [],
          },
        },
      ],
    });
    return config;
  },
};
```

Now, we can create a new MDX file in our `pages` directory:

```md
# Hello, world!

This is a blog post written in MDX.
```

Now, we can import the MDX file into a page and render it:

```js
import Post from "../hello.mdx";

export default () => <Post />;
```

## Styling MDX

MDX is just a React component, so we can style it however we want. We can use any CSS-in-JS library we want, or we can use plain old CSS. Let's use plain old CSS for this example:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

Now, we can import the CSS file into our MDX file:

```md
import './hello.css'

# Hello, world!

This is a blog post written in MDX.
```
