## This is the end of the document

The code chunk above is the only code chunk in the document. It is not a named chunk, so it is given the default name of “unnamed-chunk-1”. The chunk is evaluated and the results are displayed in the document. The chunk is also cached, so the results are not re-evaluated when the document is rendered again.

The chunk options are specified in the chunk header. The chunk header is a line of R code that begins with three backticks (```) and ends with a curly brace (}). The chunk header is followed by the code to be evaluated. The chunk header is optional, but it is recommended that you always use it. The chunk header is used to specify chunk options, such as the language of the code, the results to display, and the cache behavior.

The chunk options are specified as name-value pairs. The name-value pairs are separated by commas. The name-value pairs are enclosed in square brackets. The name-value pairs are optional, but it is recommended that you always use them. The name-value pairs are used to specify chunk options, such as the language of the code, the results to display, and the cache behavior.
